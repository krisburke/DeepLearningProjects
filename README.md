# Deep Learning Projects

This repo links to the code for projects I've completed as part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) . I completed this course in order to learn and gain skills in applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning as tools to solve problems.  The general course outline and content is located [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning). 

## Projects

### 1. Your First Neural Network 

Implemented a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.

### 2. Image Classification

Built a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images.

### 3. Text Regeneration

Trained a recurrent neural network on scripts from The Simpson's (copyright Fox) to generate new scripts.

### 4. Machine Translation

Trained a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset).

### 5. Face Generation

Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of novel and realistic human faces.
